##Objective
 The main objectives are 
 1. To read the file `tweets.txt` which is a collection of tweets, from the input folder `tweet_input` and Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted. Output is stored in the folder `tweet_output` as file `ft1.txt`.
 2. Calculate the median number of unique words from the each tweets in the text file, and update this median as tweets come in. The output is stored in the folder `tweet_output` as file `ft2.txt`.

##Coding language used: 
                            PYTHON 2.7
##Library Used: 
                            Collections

##Operating system used
                        WINDOWS 7
##Comments about the challenge:
I was the one to ask whether I can use R programming or not. Yes the computing time differed from Python implementation for larger data set. 
##User skill in the language:
                        Intermediate
